```
Load the data
data(ChickWeight)

Fit the multiple regression model
model <- lm(weight ~ Time + Diet, data = ChickWeight)

Summarize the model
summary(model)

Predict weight for Time = 10 and Diet = 1
predicted_weight <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(Time = 10, Diet = 1))
print(predicted_weight)

Find the error in the model
residuals <- residuals(model)
print(residuals)
```
